An algorithm to solve maze

<h2>Problem statement:</h2>
  A maze image,start cell coordinate and end cell coordinate will be provided. We have to find the path. Note that maze is given as an image.(So, image preprocessing stuff is involved here!!). Maze to be considered as 10*10 cells.

<br>
<b>Given maze:</b>
<br>
<img src="maze00.jpg">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Solution:</h2>
<br>
First, lets interpret the maze image. Given is a 3 channel image, walls and boundries are black and free spaces are white. Since, image is a 3d matrix of numbers lets normalize it to 1d matrix for easy processing.
